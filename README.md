# DiamondDiver

This mobile game is an Infinite Runner that I have been working on since October 2018. I am currently still polishing the game so it can be publish ready for the 2019 spring.

I've been having a lot of fun so far with the development of this game. Being partnered with a studio has been a positive impact on how I look at developing this game, it has increased the enjoyment of working on this game because of the work flow that my partner and I have when developing together.

# Production

Since the beginning of development, I've had a concrete idea for how I want the game to turn out; but certain ideas that my artist has thrown out have been awesome things that I would like to implement as updates once the game is published.
The simplicity of only swiping down to break a diamond block and tapping to quickly escape losing a life has been quite fun to test the limits of how much time the player has if they miss-swipe or miss-tap to continue falling down.

With gravity doing its thing (pushing things downward), swiping left and right to move and swiping down to break Diamond blocks makes for fun gathering resources and helps a person work on their reflexes and timing of when to maneuver or break certain blocks.

# Updates
